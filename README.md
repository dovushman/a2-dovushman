## Class Directory
For this project, I created a website that could be used as a class directory. When a user enters a persons first and last name (the middle name is optional), the table on the side is populated with their informaton including the provided information, their initials and an associated ID number. Below the name textboxes, I have a textbox where a user can enter a line ID which will delete the corresponding line in the table and in the server.

Pn my webpage I used a grid container to split the page into right and left. The textboxes are set to appear on the left side of the page and the table is set to appear on the right side of the page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that takes in user input of a persons name which is sent to the server and stored and on the front end is added to the table displaying the entered information, an associated ID and their initials derived from the entered information.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The app also has the capabilities to delete a persons information on both the front-end table and the server. This is accomplishe by having a user enter a line ID which is then processed and when located in the table and server, deleted the corresponding line.
