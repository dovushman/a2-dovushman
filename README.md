## Class Directory
For this project, I created a website that could be used as a class directory. When a user enters a person's first and last name (the middle name is optional), the table on the side is populated with their information, including the provided information, their initials, and an associated ID number. Below the name textboxes, I have a textbox where a user can enter a line ID, which will delete the corresponding line in the table and in the server.

On my webpage, I used a grid container to split the page into right and left. The textboxes are set to appear on the left side of the page, and the table is set to appear on the right side of the page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that takes user input of a person's name, which is sent to the server and stored. On the front end, it is added to the table displaying the entered information, an associated ID, and their initials derived from the entered information.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The app can also delete a person's information on the front-end table and the server. This is accomplished by having a user enter a line ID, which is then processed and deletes the corresponding line when located in the table and server.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: To test my application I had two classmates check my finished project. 
  - The first person to check my project was Mr. Foley. 
    - For my task I wanted him to enter a few names into the table and try to delete them.
    - A problem they encountered was that after importing my project into glitch, due to the project constantly running, information that I entered on my end was still located on the website on his end.
    - This comment surprised me since all of my testing was done on a local host, so this shocked me.
    - What I would change about my project would be to allow a sign-in so that if a user has a saved table, only they can access it.
  - The second person I had to check my project was Mr. Nguyen.
    - For my task, I wanted him to enter a few names into the table and try to delete them.
    - They seemed to have no problems with the program as I wiped the table before they used it.
    - A comment that surprised me was how they thought I should type check. While I see the appeal of this, I thought it would be nice to have the potential to have numbers in case somebody had a suffix such as the 2nd.
    - A change I would make based on their feedback is to make suffixes such as the 2nd an additional dropdown.
